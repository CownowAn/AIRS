# OpenPDE

This folder includes our works in DiveLab on **AI for partial differential equations**, where we particularly consider accelerating the numerical solution of PDEs with machine learning. We have included the code for [*G*-FNO](https://openreview.net/forum?id=kgAOY5x4fi) and [CFRF](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=695IYJh1Ba) We will add more in the future. Stay tuned!
